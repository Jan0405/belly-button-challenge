# Belly Button Biodiversity
-----------------
## Descripton
-------------
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Demographics information is dynamically populated based upon a user-selected test subject ID. A dropdownmenu, bar chart, bubble chart and a bonus gauge chart also update once the ID is changed. Code has been written using Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

## The dashboard includes:
+ Drop Down Menu
+ Demographic Info Panel
+ Horizontal Bar Chart
+ Bubble Chart
+ Gauge Chart
